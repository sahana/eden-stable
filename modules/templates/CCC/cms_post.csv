Homepage,default,index,"<h2>Support Cumbria</h2><p>Support Cumbria is an official collaboration of partners across Cumbria who are working together to provide community support to residents who are struggling to access basic or essential services during the coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak.</p><p>This site provides a central point to help coordinate volunteering efforts to support Cumbria residents who may need help.</p><h3>Volunteering in your community</h3><p>This website can help you find local organisations to register an interest with in volunteering in your community. They will talk to you about what you could do, and try to connect you with a suitable volunteering role.</p><p>This site also allows volunteer groups to register with Cumbria CVS and recruit volunteer support.</p><h3>Safe Volunteering</h3><p>This site is supported by agencies coordinating the response to coronavirus in Cumbria, including Cumbria County Council, Cumbria CVS, district councils, NHS and Cumbria Police.</p><p>Voluntary organisations will use their safeguarding processes to keep people safe in their communities.</p><p>New volunteer groups registering will be approved by Cumbria CVS who will help you to recruit volunteers safely.</p><h3>Donations</h3><p>People are already giving generously to a Cumbria Community Foundation fund to help charitable groups support vulnerable people affected by coronavirus.</p><p>As the virus spreads across the county, those who are vulnerable will be hardest hit and in times of crisis, many people turn to charities for support.</p><p>Like other sectors, Cumbria’s charitable organisations are likely to face challenges in the coming weeks and months.</p><p>There will be an increase in demand for their services while they are already under resourced and at capacity, with some having to completely change the way they operate. Many are reliant on volunteers and will struggle if they must self-isolate, become ill or have caring responsibilities. Many will also see a drop in their income due to cancelled fundraising events and reduced rental and activity income.</p><p>The Cumbria COVID-19 Response Fund will prioritise funding to charitable projects across the county that are supporting people affected by the virus, helping to keep them safe and supported in their homes and reducing pressure on the NHS.</p><p>Cumbria Community Foundation has contributed £100,000 to the Fund. The Foundation is aware that many people and businesses will be struggling financially, however, for those that are able and would like to donate to the Fund, they can click here or contact 01900 825760. The Fund will also provide a focus for charitable trusts, companies and other organisations wishing to support the community and charity response.</p>"

You will find information here to help out during an ongoing incident or to be ready to act in the future.</p><h3>Safe Volunteering</h3><p>It is natural that people who are local to an incident may consider attending the scene to see if they can help, or offer to assist neighbours or local residents. This is called self-deployment and falls outside of the co-ordinated response (and this website). You need to consider your own and others' safety as you do not fall under the insurance of responding organisations.</p><p>We ask you not to self-deploy and any self-deployment in the affected area is done at your own risk. Although we understand you might be keen travel to the affected area as soon as possible to offer assistance, but routes need to be kept clear for emergency services vehicles and personnel.</p><p>Instead, follow the links below, which will enable you to be deployed in a safe and effective way.</p></div></div><div class='row'><div class='large-6 medium-6 small-12 columns'><div class='panel radius'><a href='/eden/default/index/register'><img src='/eden/static/themes/CCC/img/register_volunteer.svg'/><span class='service-link'>REGISTER AS A VOLUNTEER</span></a></div></div></div><div class='row'><div class='medium-12 columns'><p>It is also important to remember that a sustained volunteering effort will be required to help people recover from a major incident and often there is more need for volunteers in the weeks following an incident.
